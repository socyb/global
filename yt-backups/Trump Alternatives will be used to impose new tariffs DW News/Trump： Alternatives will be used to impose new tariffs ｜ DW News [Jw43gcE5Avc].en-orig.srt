1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,520
US President Donald Trump wants to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,839
impose a 10% global tariff on America's

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,240
trading partners after the Supreme Court

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,360
struck out most of his previous levies

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,519
as illegal. Trump said the 6 to3 ruling

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,680
left him deeply disappointed and accused

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,240
the Supreme Court of being quote swayed

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,480
by foreign interests. The president has

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,119
vowed to deploy new methods to impose

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,720
tariffs that will not require approval,

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
including a sweeping new duty on all

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
foreign trading partners. ability to

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,280
both regulate trade and impose tariffs.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
>> W's Misha Kodowski joins me now from

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
Washington. Misha, you have been

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,520
following this story throughout the day

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,040
as expected. This decision did not sit

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,760
well with the president. What else did

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,760
he say at the press briefing?

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
>> You're right. President Trump lashed out

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
after the Supreme Court blocked his

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
emergency law tariffs. And now he plans

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,559
to sign an executive order imposing a

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,840
10% tariff on all countries replacing

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,480
the tariffs uh that uh were struck down.

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,080
He praised the conservative justices who

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,960
dissented Thomas Alo and Kavanaaugh as

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,680
brave and pro-America. At the same time,

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,720
he blasted the Supreme Court majority as

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,880
partisan and unpatriotic and even said

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,799
that their families should be ashamed.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,119
The president added that they're bowing

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,360
to political pressure and foreign

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,799
interests and announced he will not

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,640
stop. Let's take a listen.

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,400
>> Foreign countries that have been ripping

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,400
us off for years are ecstatic. They're

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,159
so happy

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,960
and they're dancing in the streets, but

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,119
they won't be dancing for long. That I

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,799
can assure you. But other alternatives

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,920
will now be used to replace the ones

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,920
that the court incorrectly rejected. We

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,520
have an alternatives.

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,520
>> What alternatives does he really have

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,520
and how wide reaching would they be?

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,520
>> Well, again, President Trump announced

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,640
plans to impose uh these 10% global

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,360
tariffs under section 122 in addition to

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
existing tariffs. The US has never used

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
this authority before and the tariffs

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,640
are scheduled to start next week. This

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,280
section 122 gives the president the

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,080
power to put a tariff on imports up to

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,640
15% for up to 150 days. It's meant to

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,560
help if the United States is losing too

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,760
much money in trade uh with other

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,239
countries or if the dollar is in trouble

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
after 150 days. The president needs

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,400
congressional approval to keep the

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
tariffs going and that's in question.

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,040
sure that they did not mean to do.

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
>> Now, has Trump offered any explanation

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,280
on how he plans to handle the hundreds

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,080
of billions of dollars already collected

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,480
under these tariffs that have now been

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,480
ruled unlawful?

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
>> Well, not much clarity here, at least at

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,360
least publicly. The administration did

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,599
not lay out a clear settled plan for

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,599
what happens to the money already

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,800
collected. President Trump says tariff

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,879
refunds issue could end in courts for

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,519
years and years. And the Supreme Court

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,480
majority opinion did not specify what

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,519
should happen to the more than roughly

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,800
$130 billion already collected. And mind

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,200
you, this number is uh uh not settled.

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,519
So it leaves the refund question quite

80
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,519
open. The National Retail Federation

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,080
here in the United States and the major

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,360
anti-tariff coalition are both calling

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,920
for full, fast, and automatic refunds.

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
So, expect more litigations.

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
>> There's Washington correspondent Misha

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,680
Kodovski. Thank you so much for your

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,680
coverage today.

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,319
>> We want to take a closer look now at

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
these developments and what they mean

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,159
for international trade and bring in

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Marco Forion. He heads the advisory firm

92
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,599
the Chartered Institute of Export and

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,920
International Trade. Welcome to DW. Now,

94
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,000
one set of tariffs is ruled illegal.

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
Another is slapped right on. How is this

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,760
10% different from the so-called

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,920
Liberation Day levies?

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,920
>> Well, it's a it's a different nuance and

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,159
it's more wide ranging and it's

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,640
short-term. The Liberation Day tariffs

101
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,599
were meant to be uh for until they were

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,600
negotiated away. These tariffs uh the

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,160
10% are for a maximum of 150 days. But I

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,199
think what we're going to see now is a

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,320
very muscular approach to negotiation by

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,440
the Trump administration with uh third

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,600
countries because they're going to

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,840
launch now a series of trade

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,040
investigations with a threat of much

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,080
higher tariffs under the uh rules that

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
the Supreme Court have said are legal.

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
Mhm.

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,199
>> In layman's terms, what will all of this

114
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,639
mean for global trade? What will be the

115
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,800
immediate impact?

116
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,400
>> The reality is we are going we're seeing

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
a continuation of what's been happening

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,800
to global trade for the past three or

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,360
four years. ongoing instability,

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,400
uncertainty and disruption which means

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,479
price pressures for the consumers uh and

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,759
the risk of availability uh and the

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,840
shrinkflation for uh people on the

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,680
shelves. This is just another reason for

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,840
uh businesses particularly those in the

126
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,479
EU to look at a multissource multimarket

127
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
approach. We cannot be dependent on a

128
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,720
single supply chain or a single nation

129
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
and we cannot be dependent on a single

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
nation as our marketplace.

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,600
>> Yeah. Now that these old terrorists have

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,520
been declared illegal, can importers

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,960
reclaim the duties they paid since April

134
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,320
of last year.

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,120
>> Yes. But and that's the problem with so

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,240
much in international trade. uh so yes

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,280
they should be entitled to uh reclaim

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,479
what has been judged to be illegal uh

139
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,960
tariff payments however the process for

140
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,800
doing that and the fact that this is

141
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
going to be tied up now in a whole

142
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,039
bureaucratic process means that there's

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,600
no clarity uh on this and I think the

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,960
best thing that that companies can do is

145
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,840
to uh hold fast and wait until a little

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
bit more clarity comes because uh it's

147
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,639
very it's very obvious that what

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,680
President Trump is trying to do is to

149
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,479
disrupt global supply chains to disrupt

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,199
the global multilateral order and impose

151
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,039
an America first program of activities

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,039
and we've seen the impact of that. We've

153
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,240
seen disruption to supply chains. We've

154
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,960
seen uh businesses facing uncertainty.

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,120
And as a result, big businesses,

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,759
companies like Stalantis and others have

157
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,400
made decisions to invest in the US to

158
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
build their capabilities in the US

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
because of these original set of

160
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,520
tariffs. And I'm certain that President

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,039
Trump and the administration in

162
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,639
Washington have no intent on leaving

163
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,720
taking their foot off the pedal,

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
releasing the pressure uh because they

165
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,560
want more of that type of investment in

166
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,199
the US to grow the manufacturing base in

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,199
the US.

168
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
>> So do you think it's actually paying off

169
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,759
because the intent of these tariffs

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,560
under the America first umbrella was the

171
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,680
revival of American manufacturing. Is

172
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,080
that really happening?

173
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,880
Well, first we've seen billions being

174
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,440
generated as a result of the tariffs. Uh

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,080
we have seen huge announcements from

176
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,120
companies like Stellantis and Ro and

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,880
others that they are going to invest

178
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,440
significantly to grow manufacturing

179
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,360
capability uh in the US. uh but the the

180
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,080
transition between what have been

181
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,800
decades of decline in US manufacturing

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,199
and the uh the impact of those uh

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,000
investment announcements there's a lag

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
uh so what we've seen over the last

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,400
quarter uh in fact the last half a year

186
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,120
is a decline in uh US manufacturing uh

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,520
uh output we've seen an increase in the

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,199
trade deficit and these are factors that

189
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,599
the Trump administration will be taking

190
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,400
a long hard look at as They seek to

191
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,479
pursue that America first program.

192
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,599
>> Tariffs, and we've heard it many times

193
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,919
are Trump's favorite word that zooming

194
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,639
out a bit. How big a blow is this ruling

195
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,960
for his overall economic strategy that

196
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,199
was so heavily reliant on tariffs?

197
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,960
>> Well, anyone who listened to his

198
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,080
response this evening could see he's

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,560
really angry at what happened. However,

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,240
I don't think it was unexpected and the

201
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,680
fact that they've come forward

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,800
instantaneously with a new approach, the

203
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,440
10% tariff for the next 150 days and

204
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,839
they will be uh launching uh trade

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,880
investigations on a whole bunch of uh

206
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,360
products, a whole bunch of uh countries

207
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,160
uh to try and exert more pressure and to

208
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,800
apply differential tariffs uh on them.

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,440
And I'm sure over the coming weeks and

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,440
months there will be new approaches to

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
impose tariffs, put pressure on

212
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
countries because what he's doing is

213
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,920
using trade and tariffs as a

214
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,640
geopolitical lever. And he wants to

215
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,399
secure bilateral trade arrangements to

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,160
the advantage of the US, to the

217
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
advantage of US consumers, to the

218
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,279
advantage of US manufacturing. None of

219
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,560
that changes. The way he goes about it

220
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,800
may shift slightly. The legal basis for

221
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,720
his approach may shift slightly, but

222
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
what we can be sure of is that he is

223
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,440
absolutely cleareyed and determined to

224
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,360
impose that America first agenda.

225
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
>> What a time to be a trade adviser. We

226
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,920
just spoke to one of them, Marco

227
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
Foriona, director general of the

228
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,200
Chartered Institute of Export and

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,760
International Trade. Thank you so much

230
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,760
for all those insights.

231
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,519
Before the German reaction to the

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,760
Supreme Court decision, our chief

233
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
political editor, Mika Kufna, caught up

234
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,120
with the CDU lawmaker and foreign policy

235
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,560
spokesperson Jurgen Hhat at the party's

236
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,360
conference.

237
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,839
>> Jurgen Hart, is this ruling a gamecher

238
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,160
for the way Donald Trump can conduct

239
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,320
international politics? too early to

240
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,720
judge on and I think also from outside

241
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,480
it's difficult for us to um comment a

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,160
decision of the Supreme Court in a

243
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,560
sovereign democratic country

244
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,920
constitutional questions are always uh

245
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,079
in a core of uh the sovereignity of a

246
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,480
state but looking to that what might be

247
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,200
the consequences I think about that

248
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,600
Donald Trump's tax policy is very much

249
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,519
based on the fact that he has a huge

250
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,399
income from tariffs and uh that the

251
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,120
trade relations of US to other regions

252
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,760
like European Union or India for example

253
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,720
are very much um driven by uh the tariff

254
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,640
system regime and therefore um I think

255
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,360
we also have to think about what is the

256
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,880
consequence for us uh maybe a new

257
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,760
momentum in trade negotiations with US

258
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,640
uh and uh also new momentum for some

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,519
parts of the business uh for their

260
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,160
future business in US or here in Europe.

261
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,720
>> Does this change the way you perceive

262
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,399
Donald Trump can act? Now there's a

263
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,760
court ruling. Do you think he will stick

264
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,440
to it?

265
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,839
>> Uh I think Donald Trump's uh um was very

266
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:23,600
much aware of not to have a um

267
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,880
defeat in uh in on on the Supreme Court

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,720
and not to be uh a majority against him

269
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,440
in the Congress. and uh there was a

270
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,320
majority close to a majority against him

271
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
in the visa question in the Senate and

272
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,480
now there's a decision of the Supreme

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,160
Court. I think he has to think about

274
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,399
what are the consequences for its

275
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,360
politics up to the midterm elections but

276
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,680
we will see Americans will uh take the

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,160
right decisions and right consequences

278
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,320
of that what happened today. Thank you

279
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,320
very much.
